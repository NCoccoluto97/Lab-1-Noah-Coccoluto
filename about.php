    <h2>The Story of Hot Take</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all started one October afternoon in Burlington Vermont. Two students at the University of Vermont had to choose what they were going to do for their Computer Science course. The two students, named Bryan and Noah, knew they wanted to do their best as to impress their awesome professor. Pooling their interests of business and fashion together, the two students decided to make a website with the purpose of selling men's fashion. However, they knew that in order for their website to stand out from its competition, their website had to be something that would grab someone's attention, something that would earn them an A. In order to stand out, they came up with the idea to make a point of selling their products at a lower rate than what their competitors might sell them at. Noah and Bryan swore to always offer the lowest possible prices for their merchandise, and for anything sold from their website. 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was around this time where their website go its name; Hot Take. A 'hot take' is a sort of slang term for getting a good deal or finding a diamond in the ruff. However, Noah and Bryan also noticed that even while offering the lowest possible prices, costs for a lot of men's fashion designer clothing is still quite expensive. It seemed like a waste to the two of them, stepping back, to be spending so much money on clothing when some people around the world can't afford to put a shirt on their backs. As a resolution, the two decided to make Hot Take donate a portion of its profits to charity. Thinking more and more about it, the men decided to give customers multiple options as to the charity recipient from their purchase. They figured that everyone around the world has different issues and is more sympathetic to more causes that just the one they would be choosing for them. Along with that, Hot Take only allows certain authorized users to sell items on the website, as to ensure buyer security and peace of mind. Although the website was really only made for a college course, Noah and Bryan took it a step further and made Hot Take a fully functioning online website capable to online purchases. In the end Noah and Bryan are very proud and happy with the final product of their labor, and they both firmly believe that Hot Take is an incredible website.
